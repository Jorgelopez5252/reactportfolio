          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I was born in San Diego, California but moved to Mesa, Arizona when
            I was 7 years old and you could say I am a native here at this
            point. I am very passionate about working with others, the
            collaboration of many ideas fills my passion on being a Full Stack
            Web Developer. I am no stranger to the weird and uncomfortable, and
            I feel the best way to learn is to place yourself in the unfamiliar
            and unknown as your own results can and will surprise you!
          </p>
