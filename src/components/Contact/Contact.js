          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>I was born in San Diego, California but moved to Mesa, Arizona when I was 7 years old and you could say I am a native here at this point. I am very passionate about working with others, the collaboration of many ideas fills my passion on being a Full Stack Web Developer. I am no stranger to the weird and uncomfortable, and I feel the best way to learn is to place yourself in the unfamiliar and unknown as your own results can and will surprise you!</p>
